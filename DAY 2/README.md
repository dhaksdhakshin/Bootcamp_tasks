# Review from an Average Student’s Perspective

## Task 1: Data Science Applications Brainstorm

### What I Learned:

- Data Science is used in many fields like sports, agriculture, and cybersecurity.

### Challenges:

- Finding unique applications beyond class examples.
- Extra research was needed to understand each use case.

### Final Thought:

- Helped me explore real-world applications beyond textbooks.

## Task 2: AI, ML, DL Relationship Diagram

### What I Learned:

- AI → ML → DL (Deep Learning is part of ML, and ML is part of AI).
- Diagrams help in understanding concepts better.

### Challenges:

- Drawing the diagram neatly.
- Keeping explanations simple and clear.

### Final Thought:

- Visual learning makes complex topics easier.

## Task 3: Data Scientist Roles Research

### What I Learned:

- Data Scientists do more than coding—data cleaning, visualization, and business insights matter too.

### Challenges:

- Differentiating roles like Data Scientist vs. Data Engineer.
- Writing concise but informative descriptions.

### Final Thought:

- Data Science is about solving problems, not just coding.

## Task 4: Data Science Lifecycle Example

### What I Learned:

- The process includes problem identification, data processing, modeling, evaluation, and deployment.

### Challenges:

- Breaking a real-world example into lifecycle steps.
- Differentiating between data preprocessing and feature engineering.

### Final Thought:

- Understanding the full workflow is essential, not just model building.

## Task 5: Data Science Ethics Discussion

### What I Learned:

- AI can be biased or invade privacy if not designed properly.

### Challenges:

- Choosing the most important ethical issue.
- Writing a balanced explanation.

### Final Thought:

- AI must be used responsibly to avoid harm.

## Bonus Task: Data Science Career Paths

### What I Learned:

- Some roles focus on coding (ML Engineer), while others focus on insights (Data Analyst).

### Challenges:

- Differentiating similar roles.
- Job responsibilities vary across companies.

### Final Thought:

- I need to explore which career path suits me best.

## Overall Reflection

### What I Gained:

- Real-world knowledge of Data Science.
- Understanding of career paths.
- The importance of AI ethics.

### Challenges Faced:

- Summarizing research in simple words.
- Making clear diagrams and structured explanations.

### Final Thought:

- This experience improved my understanding and research skills.
